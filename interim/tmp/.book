A brief description of this peculiar people, and of their\nethical, linguistic, social, and religious life, seems to be called for\nhere in order that the following poem may be the better understood.</p><p>Finland (Finnish, Suomi or Suomenmaa, the swampy region, of which\nFinland, or Fen-land is said to be a Swedish translation, is at  )</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">present a Grand-Duchy in the north-western part of</p>",
  "page-11": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">the Russian empire,\nbordering on Olenetz, Archangel, Sweden, Norway, and the Baltic Sea,\nits area being more than 144,000 square miles, and inhabited by some\n2,000,000 of people, the last remnants of a race driven back from the\nEast, at a very early day, by advancing tribes.  The Finlanders live in\na land of marshes and mountains, lakes and rivers, seas, gulfs,\nislands, and inlets, and they call themselves Suomilainen,\nFen-dwellers.  The climate is more severe than that of Sweden.  The\nmean yearly temperature in the north is about 27�F., and about 38�F., at\nHelsingfors, the capital of Finland.  In the southern districts the\nwinter is seven months long, and in the northern provinces the sun\ndisappears entirely during the months of December and January.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The inhabitants are strong and hardy, with bright, intelligent faces,\nhigh cheek-bones, yellow hair in early life, and with brown hair in\nmature age.  With regard to</p>",
  "page-12": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">their social habits, morals, and manners,\nall travellers are unanimous in speaking well of them.  Their temper is\nuniversally mild; they are slow to anger, and when angry they keep\nsilence.  They are happy-hearted, affectionate to one another, and\nhonorable and honest in their dealings with strangers.  They are a\ncleanly people, being much given to the use of vapor-baths.  This trait\nis a conspicuous note of their character from their earliest history to\nthe present day.  Often in the runes of The Kalevala reference is made\nto the \"cleansing and healing virtues of the vapors of the heated\nbathroom.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The skull of the Finn belongs to the brachycephalic (short-headed)\nclass of Retzius.  Indeed the Finn-organization has generally been\nregarded as Mongol, though Mongol of a modified type.  His color is\nswarthy, and his eyes are gray.  He is not inhospitable, but not\nover-easy of access; nor is he a friend of new fashions.  Steady,\ncareful, laborious, he is valuable in the</p>",
  "page-13": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">mine, valuable in the field,\nvaluable oil shipboard, and, withal, a brave soldier on land.</p><p>The Finns are a very ancient people.  It is claimed, too, that they\nbegan earlier than any other European nation to collect and preserve\ntheir ancient folk-lore.  Tacitus, writing in the very beginning of the\nsecond century of the Christian era, mentions the Fenni, as he calls\nthem, in the 46th chapter of his De Moribus Germanoram.  He says of\nthem: \"The Finns are extremely wild, and live in abject poverty.  They\nhave no arms, no horses, no dwellings; they live on herbs, they clothe\nthemselves in skins, and they sleep on the ground.  Their only\nresources are their arrows, which for the lack of iron are tipped with\nbone.\"  Strabo and the great geographer, Ptolemy, also mention this\ncurious people.  There is evidence that at one time they were spread\nover large portions of Europe and western Asia.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Perhaps it should be stated here that the copper, so</p>",
  "page-14": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">often mentioned in\nThe Kalevala, when taken literally, was probably bronze, or \"hardened\ncopper,\" the amount and quality of the alloy used being not now known.\nThe prehistoric races of Europe were acquainted with bronze implements.</p><p>It may be interesting to note in this connection that Canon Isaac\nTaylor, and Professor Sayce have but very recently awakened great\ninterest in this question, in Europe especially, by the reading of\npapers before the British Philological Association, in which they argue\nin favor of the Finnic origin of the Aryans.  For this new theory these\nscholars present exceedingly strong evidence, and they conclude that\nthe time of the separation of the Aryan from the Finnic stock must have\nbeen more than five thousand years ago.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The Finnish nation has one of the most sonorous and flexible of\nlanguages.  Of the cultivated tongues of Europe, the Magyar, or\nHungarian, bears the most</p>",
  "page-15": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">positive signs of a deep-rooted similarity to\nthe Finnish.  Both belong to the Ugrian stock of agglutinative\nlanguages, i.e., those which preserve the root most carefully, and\neffect all changes of grammar by suffixes attached to the original\nstein.  Grimin has shown that both Gothic and Icelandic present traces\nof Finnish influence.</p><p>The musical element of a language, the vowels, are well developed in\nFinnish, and their due sequence is subject to strict rules of euphony.\nThe dotted o; (equivalent to the French eu of the first syllable must  )</p><p>be followed by an e or an i.  The Finnish, like all Ugrian tongues,\nadmits rhyme, but with reluctance, and prefers alliteration.  Their\nalphabet consists of but nineteen letters, and of these, b, c, d, f, g,\nare found only in a few foreign words, and many others are never found\ninitial.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">One of the characteristic features of this language,</p>",
  "page-16": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">and one that is\nlikewise characteristic of the Magyar, Turkish, Mordvin, and other\nkindred tongues, consists in the frequent use of endearing diminutives.\nBy a series of suffixes to the names of human beings, birds, fishes,\ntrees, plants, stones, metals, and even actions, events, and feelings,\ndiminutives are obtained, which by their form, present the names so\nmade in different colors; they become more naive, more childlike,\neventually more roguish, or humorous, or pungent.  These traits can\nscarcely be rendered in English; for, as Robert Ferguson remarks: \"The\nEnglish language is not strong in diminutives, and therefore it lacks\nsome of the most effective means for the expression of affectionate,\ntender, and familiar relations.\"  In this respect all translations from\nthe Finnish into English necessarily must fall short of the original.\nThe same might be said of the many emotional interjections in which the\nFinnish, in common with all Ugrian dialects, abounds. </p>",
  "page-17": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">With the\nexception of these two characteristics of the Ugrian languages, the\nchief beauties of the Finnish verse admit of an apt rendering into\nEnglish.  The structure of the sentences is very simple indeed, and\nadverbs and adjectives are used sparingly.</p><p>Finnish is the language of a people who live pre-eminently close to\nnature, and are at home amongst the animals of the wilderness, beasts\nand birds, winds, and woods, and waters, falling snows, and flying\nsands, and rolling rocks, and these are carefully distinguished by\ncorresponding verbs of ever-changing acoustic import.  Conscious of the\nfact that, in a people like the Finns where nature and nature-worship\nform the centre of all their life, every word connected with the powers\nand elements of nature must be given its fall value, great care has\nbeen taken in rendering these finely shaded verbs.  A glance at the\nmythology of this interesting people will place the import of this\nremark in better view.</p>",
  "page-18": "<p class=\" stretch-last-line \">In the earliest age of Suomi, it appears that the people worshiped the\nconspicuous objects in nature under their respective, sensible forms.\nAll beings were persons.  The Sun, Moon, Stars, the Earth, the Air, and\nthe Sea, were to the ancient Finns, living, self-conscious beings.\nGradually the existence of invisible agencies and energies was\nrecognized, and these were attributed to superior persons who lived\nindependent of these visible entities, but at the same time were\nconnected with them.  The basic idea in Finnish mythology seems to lie\nin this: that all objects in nature are governed by invisible deities,\ntermed haltiat, regents or genii.  These haltiat, like members of the\nhuman family, have distinctive bodies and spirits; but the minor ones\nare somewhat immaterial and formless, and their existences are entirely\nindependent of the objects in which they are particularly interested.\nThey are all immortal, but they rank according to the relative\nimportance of their</p>",
  "page-19": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">respective charges.  The lower grades of the\nFinnish gods are sometimes subservient to the deities of greater\npowers, especially to those who rule respectively the air, the water,\nthe field, and the forest.  Thus, Pilajatar, the daughter of the aspen,\nalthough as divine as Tapio, the god of the woodlands, is necessarily\nhis servant.\nOne of the most notable characteristics of the Finnish mythology is\nthe interdependence among the gods.  \"Every deity\", says Castren,\n\"however petty he may be, rules in his own sphere as a substantial,\nindependent power, or, to speak in the spirit of The Kalevala, as a\nself-ruling householder.  The god of the Polar-star only governs an\ninsignificant spot in the vault of the sky, but on this spot he knows\nno master.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The Finnish deities, like the ancient gods of Italy and Greece, are\ngenerally represented in pairs, and all the gods are probably wedded.\nThey have their individual abodes and are surrounded by</p>",
  "page-20": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">their\nrespective families.  The Primary object of worship among the early\nFinns was most probably the visible sky with its sun, moon, and stars,\nits aurora-lights, its thunders and its lightnings.  The heavens\nthemselves were thought divine.  Then a personal deity of the heavens,\ncoupled with the name of his abode, was the next conception; finally\nthis sky-god was chosen to represent the supreme Ruler.  To the sky,\nthe sky-god, and the supreme God, the term Jumala (thunder-home was  )</p><p>given.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">In course of time, however, when the Finns came to have more purified\nideas about religion, they called the sky Taivas and the sky-god Ukko.\nThe word, Ukko, seems related to the Magyar Agg, old, and meant,\ntherefore, an old being, a grandfather; but ultimately it came to be\nused exclusively as the name of the highest of the Finnish deities.\nFrost, snow, hail, ice, wind and rain,</p>",
  "page-21": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">sunshine and shadow, are thought\nto come from the hands of Ukko.  He controls the clouds; he is called\nin The Kalevala, \"The Leader of the Clouds,\" \"The Shepherd of the\nLamb-Clouds,\" \"The God of the Breezes,\" \"The Golden King,\" \"The Silvern\nRuler of the Air,\" and \"The Father of the Heavens.\"  He wields the\nthunder-bolts, striking down the spirits of evil on the mountains, and\nis therefore termed, \"The Thunderer,\" like the Greek Zeus, and his\nabode is called, \"The Thunder-Home.\"  Ukko is often represented as\nsitting upon a cloud in the vault of the sky, and bearing on his\nshoulders the firmament, and therefore he is termed, \"The Pivot of the\nHeavens.\"  He is armed as an omnipotent warrior; his fiery arrows are\nforged from copper, the lightning is his sword, and the rainbow his\nbow, still called Ukkon Kaari.  Like the German god, Thor, Ukko swings\na hammer; and, finally, we find, in a vein of familiar symbolism, that\nhis skirt sparkles with</p>",
  "page-22": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">fire, that his stockings are blue, and his\nshoes, crimson colored.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">In the following runes, Ukko here and there interposes.  Thus, when the\nSun and Moon were stolen from the heavens, and hidden away in a cave of\nthe copper-bearing mountain, by the wicked hostess of the dismal\nSariola, he, like Atlas in the mythology of Greece, relinquishes the\nsupport of the heavens, thunders along the borders of the darkened\nclouds, and strikes fire from his sword to kindle a new sun and a new\nmoon.  Again, when Lemminkainen is hunting the fire-breathing horse of\nPiru, Ukko, invoked by the reckless hero, checks the speed of the\nmighty courser by opening the windows of heaven, and showering upon him\nflakes of snow, balls of ice, and hailstones of iron.  Usually,\nhowever, Ukko prefers to encourage a spirit of independence among his\nworshipers.  Often we find him, in the runes, refusing to heed the call\nof his people</p>",
  "page-23": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">for help, as when Ilmatar, the daughter of the air,\nvainly invoked him to her aid, that Wainamoinen, already seven hundred\nyears unborn, might be delivered.  So also Wainamoinen beseeches Ukko\nin vain to check the crimson streamlet flowing from his knee wounded by\nan axe in the hands of Hisi.  Ukko, however, with all his power, is by\nno means superior to the Sun, Moon, and other bodies dwelling in the\nheavens; they are uninfluenced by him, and are considered deities in\ntheir own right.  Thus, Paeivae means both sun and sun-god; Kun means\nmoon and moon-god; and Taehti and Ottava designate the Polar-star and\nthe Great Bear respectively, as well as the deities of these bodies.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The Sun and the Moon have each a consort, and sons, and daughters.  Two\nsons only of Paeivae appear in The Kalevala, one comes to aid\nWainamoinen in his efforts to destroy the mystic Fire-fish, by throwing\nfrom the heavens to the girdle of the hero, a \"magic</p>",
  "page-24": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">knife,\nsilver-edged, and golden-handled;\" the other son, Panu, the Fire-child,\nbrings back to Kalevala the fire that bad been stolen by Louhi, the\nwicked hostess of Pohyola.  From this myth Castren argues that the\nancient Finns regarded fire as a direct emanation from the Sun.  The\ndaughters of the Sun, Moon, Great Bear, Polar-star, and of the other\nheavenly dignitaries, are represented as ever-young and beautiful\nmaidens, sometimes seated on the bending branches of the forest-trees,\nsometimes on the crimson rims of the clouds, sometimes on the rainbow,\nsometimes on the dome of heaven.  These daughters are believed to be\nskilled to perfection in the arts of spinning and weaving,\naccomplishments probably attributed to them from the fanciful likeness\nof the rays of light to the warp of the weaver's web.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The Sun's career of usefulness and beneficence in bringing light and\nlife to Northland is seldom varied. </p>",
  "page-25": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Occasionally he steps from his\naccustomed path to give important information to his suffering\nworshipers.  For example, when the Star and the Moon refuse the\ninformation, the Sun tells the Virgin Mariatta, where her golden infant\nlies bidden.</p><p>\"Yonder is thy golden infant,\nThere thy holy babe lies sleeping,\nHidden to his belt in water,\nHidden in the reeds and rushes.\"</p><p>Again when the devoted mother of the reckless hero, Lemminkainen,\n(chopped to pieces by the Sons Of Nana, as in the myth of Osiris was  )</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">raking together the fragments of his body from the river of Tuoui, and\nfearing that the sprites of the Death-stream might resent her\nintrusion, the Sun, in answer to her entreaties, throws his Powerful\nrays upon the dreaded Shades, and sinks them into a deep sleep, while\nthe mother gathers up the fragments of her son's body in safety.  This\nrune of the Kalevala is particularly</p>",
  "page-26": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">interesting as showing the belief\nthat the dead can be restored to life through the blissful light of\nheaven.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Among the other deities of the air are the Luonnotars, mystic maidens,\nthree of whom were created by the rubbing of Ukko's hands upon his left\nknee.  They forthwith walk the crimson borders of the clouds, and one\nsprinkles white milk, one sprinkles red milk, and the third sprinkles\nblack milk over the hills and mountains; thus they become the \"mothers\nof iron,\" as related in the ninth rune of The Kalevala.  In the highest\nregions of the heavens, Untar, or Undutar, has her abode, and presides\nover mists and fogs.  These she passes through a silver sieve before\nsending them to the earth.  There are also goddesses of the winds, one\nespecially noteworthy, Suvetar (suve, south, summer), the goddess of\nthe south-wind.  She is represented as a kind-hearted deity, healing\nher sick and afflicted followers with honey, which she lets drop from\nthe</p>",
  "page-27": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">clouds, and she also keeps watch over the herds grazing in the\nfields and forests.\nSecond only to air, water is the element held most in reverence by the\nFinns and their kindred tribes.  \"It could hardly be otherwise,\" says\nCastren, \"for as soon as the soul of the savage began to suspect that\nthe godlike is spiritual, super-sensual, then, even though he continues\nto pay reverence to matter, he in general values it the more highly the\nless compact it is.  He sees on the one hand how easy it is to lose his\nlife on the surging waves, and on the other, he sees that from these\nsame waters he is nurtured, and his life prolonged.\"  Thus it is that\nthe map of Finland is to this day full of names like Pyhojarvi (sacred\nlake and Pyhajoki (sacred river).  Some of the Finlanders still offer  )</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">goats and calves to these sacred waters; and many of the Ugrian clans\nstill sacrifice the reindeer to the river Ob.  In Esthonia is a\nrivulet, Vohanda, held in such</p>",
  "page-28": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">reverence that until very recently, none\ndared to fell a tree or cut a shrub in its immediate vicinity, lest\ndeath should overtake the offender within a year, in punishment for his\nsacrilege.  The lake, Eim, is still held sacred by the Esthonians, and\nthe Eim-legend is thus told by F. Thiersch, quoted also by Grimm and by\nMace da Charda:</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"Savage, evil men dwelt by its borders. They neither mowed the meadows\nwhich it watered, nor sowed the fields which it made fruitful, but\nrobbed and murdered, insomuch that its clear waves grew dark with the\nblood of the slaughtered men.  Then did the lake Him mourn, and one\nevening it called together all its fishes, and rose aloft with them\ninto the air.  When the robbers heard the sound, they exclaimed: 'Eim\nhath arisen; let us gather its fishes and treasures.'  But the fishes\nhad departed with the lake, and nothing was found on the bottom but\nsnakes, and lizards, and toads. </p>",
  "page-29": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">And Eim rose higher, and higher, and\nhastened through the air like a white cloud.  And the hunters in the\nforest said: 'What bad weather is coming on!'  The herdsmen said: 'What\na white swan is flying above there!'  For the whole night the lake\nhovered among the stars, and in the morning the reapers beheld it\nsinking.  And from the swan grew a white ship, and from the ship a dark\ntrain of clouds; and a voice came from the waters: 'Get thee hence with\nthy harvest, for I will dwell beside thee.'  Then they bade the lake\nwelcome, if it would only bedew their fields and meadows; and it sank\ndown and spread itself out in its home to the full limits.  Then the\nlake made all the neighborhood fruitful, and the fields became green,\nand the people danced around it, so that the old men grew joyous as the\nyouth.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The chief water-god is Ahto, on the etymology of which the Finnish\nlanguage throws little light.  It is curiously like Ahti, another name\nfor the reckless</p>",
  "page-30": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">Lemminkainen.  This water-god, or \"Wave-host,\" as he\nis called, lives with his \"cold and cruel-hearted spouse,\" Wellamo, at\nthe bottom of the sea, in the chasms of the Salmon-rocks, where his\npalace, Ahtola, is constructed.  Besides the fish that swim in his\ndominions, particularly the salmon, the trout, the whiting, the perch,\nthe herring, and the white-fish, he possesses a priceless treasure in\nthe Sampo, the talisman of success, which Louhi, the hostess of\nPohyola, dragged into the sea in her efforts to regain it from the\nheroes of Kalevala.  Ever eager for the treasures of others, and\ngenerally unwilling to return any that come into his possession, Ahto\nis not incapable of generosity.  For example, once when a shepherd lad\nwas whittling a stick on the bank of a river, he dropped his knife into\nthe stream.  Ahto, as in the fable, \"Mercury and the Woodman,\" moved by\nthe tears of the unfortunate lad, swam to the scene, dived to the\nbottom, brought up a knife of gold, and gave it to the</p>",
  "page-31": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">young shepherd.\nInnocent and honest, the herd-boy said the knife was not his.  Then\nAhto dived again, and brought up a knife of silver, which he gave to\nthe lad, but this in turn was not accepted.  Thereupon the Wave-host\ndived again, and the third time brought the right knife to the boy who\ngladly recognized his own, and received it with gratitude.  To the\nshepherd-lad Ahto gave the three knives as a reward for his honesty.</p><p>A general term for the other water-hosts living not only in the sea,\nbut also in the rivers, lakes, cataracts, and fountains, is Ahtolaiset\n(inhabitants of Ahtola), \"Water-people,\" \"People of the Foam and\nBillow,\" \"Wellamo's Eternal People.\"  Of these, some have specific\nnames; as Allotar (wave-goddess), Koskenneiti (cataract-maiden),\nMelatar (goddess of the helm), and in The Kalevala these are sometimes\npersonally invoked.  Of these minor deities, Pikku Mies (the Pigmy is  )</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">the most noteworthy.  Once when the</p>",
  "page-32": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">far-outspreading branches of the\nprimitive oak-tree shut out the light of the sun from Northland, Pikku\nMies, moved by the entreaties of Wainamoinen, emerged from the sea in a\nsuit of copper, with a copper hatchet in his belt, quickly grew from a\npigmy to a gigantic hero, and felled the mighty oak with the third\nstroke of his axe.  In general the water-deities are helpful and full\nof kindness; some, however, as Wetehilien and Iku-Turso, find their\ngreatest pleasure in annoying and destroying their fellow-beings.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Originally the Finlanders regarded the earth as a godlike existence\nwith personal powers, and represented as a beneficent mother bestowing\npeace and plenty on all her worthy worshipers.  In evidence of this we\nfind the names, Maa-emae (mother-earth), and Maan-emo (mother of the\nearth), given to the Finnish Demeter.  She is always represented as a\ngoddess of great powers, and, after suitable invocation, is ever\nwilling and able to</p>",
  "page-33": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">help her helpless sufferers.  She is according to\nsome mythologists espoused to Ukko, who bestows upon her children the\nblessings of sunshine and rain, as Ge is wedded to Ouranos, Jordh to\nOdhin, and Papa to Rangi.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Of the minor deities of the earth, who severally govern the plants,\nsuch as trees, rye, flax, and barley, Wirokannas only is mentioned in\nThe Kalevala.  Once, for example, this \"green robed Priest of the\nForest\" abandoned for a time his presidency over the cereals in order\nto baptize the infant-son of the Virgin Mariatta.  Once again\nWirokannas left his native sphere of action, this time making a most\nmiserable and ludicrous failure, when he emerged from the wilderness\nand attempted to slay the Finnish Taurus, as described in the runes\nthat follow.  The agricultural deities, however, receive but little\nattention from the Finns, who, with their cold and cruel winters, and\ntheir short but delightful summers,</p>",
  "page-34": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">naturally neglect the cultivation\nof the fields, for cattle-raising, fishing, and hunting.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The forest deities proper, however, are held in high veneration.  Of\nthese the chief is Tapio, \"The Forest-Friend,\" \"The Gracious God of the\nWoodlands.\"  He is represented as a very tall and slender divinity,\nwearing a long, brown board, a coat of tree-moss, and a high-crowned\nhat of fir-leaves.  His consort is Mielikki, \"The Honey-rich Mother of\nthe Woodland,\" \"The Hostess of the Glen and Forest.\"  When the hunters\nwere successful she was represented as beautiful and benignant, her\nhands glittering with gold and silver ornaments, wearing ear-rings and\ngarlands of gold, with hair-bands silver-tinseled, on her forehead\nstrings of pearls, and with blue stockings on her feet, and red strings\nin her shoes.  But if the game-bag came back empty, she was described\nas a hateful, hideous thing, robed in untidy rags, and shod with straw.\nShe carries the keys to the</p>",
  "page-35": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">treasury of Metsola, her husband's abode,\nand her bountiful chest of honey, the food of all the forest-deities,\nis earnestly sought for by all the weary hunters of Suomi.  These\ndeities are invariably described as gracious and tender-hearted,\nprobably because they are all females with the exception of Tapio and\nhis son, Nyrikki, a tall and stately youth who is engaged in building\nbridges over marshes and forest-streams, through which the herds must\npass on their way to the woodland-pastures.  Nyrikki also busies\nhimself in blazing the rocks and the trees to guide the heroes to their\nfavorite hunting-grounds.  Sima-suu (honey-mouth), one of the tiny\ndaughters of Tapio, by playing on her Sima-pilli (honey-flute), also\nacts as guide to the deserving hunters.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Hiisi, the Finnish devil, bearing also the epithets, Juntas, Piru, and\nLempo, is the chief of the forest-demons, and is inconceivably wicked.\nHe was brought</p>",
  "page-36": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">into the world consentaneously with Suoyatar, from whose\nspittle, as sung in The Kalevala, he formed the serpent.  This demon is\ndescribed as cruel, horrible, hideous, and bloodthirsty, and all the\nmost painful diseases and misfortunes that ever afflict mortals are\nsupposed to emanate from him.  This demon, too, is thought by the\nFinlanders to have a hand in all the evil done in the world.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Turning from the outer world to man, we find deities whose energies are\nused only in the domain of human existence.  \"These deities,\" says\nCastren, \"have no dealings with the higher, spiritual nature of man.\nAll that they do concerns man solely as an object in nature.  Wisdom\nand law, virtue and justice, find in Finnish mythology no protector\namong the gods, who trouble themselves only about the temporal wants of\nhumanity.\"  The Love-goddess was Sukkamieli (stocking-lover).\n\"Stockings,\" says Castren gravely, \"are</p>",
  "page-37": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">soft and tender things, and the\ngoddess of love was so called because she interests herself in the\nsoftest and tenderest feelings of the heart.\"  This conception,\nhowever, is as farfetched as it is modern.  The Love-deity of the\nancient Finns was Lempo, the evil-demon.  It is more reasonable\ntherefore to suppose that the Finns chose the son of Evil to look after\nthe feelings of the human heart, because they regarded love as an\ninsufferable passion, or frenzy, that bordered on insanity, and incited\nin some mysterious manner by an evil enchanter.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Uni is the god of sleep, and is described as a kind-hearted and welcome\ndeity.  Untamo is the god of dreams, and is always spoken of as the\npersonification of indolence.  Munu tenderly looks after the welfare of\nthe human eye.  This deity, to say the least is an oculist of long and\nvaried experience, in all probability often consulted in Finland\nbecause of the blinding snows and</p>",
  "page-38": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">piercing winds of the north.  Lemmas\nis a goddess in the mythology of the Finns who dresses the wounds of\nher faithful sufferers, and subdues their pains.  Suonetar is another\ngoddess of the human frame, and plays a curious and important part in\nthe restoration to life of the reckless Lemminkainen, as described in\nthe following runes.

It is thus that the Iliad is inseparably united, and,\nas it were, immersed in the stately hexametre, and the French epics, in\nthe graceful Alexandrine verse.  The metre of the Kalevala is the\n\"eight-syllabled trochaic, with the part-line echo,\" and is the\ncharacteristic verse of the Finns.  The natural speech of this people\nis poetry.  The young men and maidens, the old men and matrons, in\ntheir interchange of ideas, unwittingly fall into verse.  The genius of\ntheir language aids to this end, inasmuch as their words are strongly\ntrochaic.</p>",
  "page-69": "<p>This wonderfully versatile metre admits of keeping the right medium\nbetween the dignified, almost prancing hexameter, and the shorter\nmetres of the lyrics.  Its feet are nimble and fleet, but yet full of\nvigor and expressiveness.  In addition, the Kalevala uses alliteration,\nand thus varies the rhythm of time with the rhythm of sound.  This\nmetre is especially fit for the numerous expressions of endearment in\nwhich the Finnish epic abounds.  It is more especially the love of the\nmother for her children, and the love of the children for their mother,\nthat find frequent and ever-tender expression in the sonorous lines of\nthe Kalevala.  The Swedish translation by Castren, the German, by\nSchiefner, and the Hungarian, by Barna, as well as the following\nEnglish translation, are in the original metre of the Kalevala.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">To prove that this peculiar and fascinating style of verse is of very\nancient origin, the following lines have</p>",
