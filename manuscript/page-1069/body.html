On the long-point of the fish-lake!"
"Tell me, O thou woodland-mother,
How to journey to my people,
How to find mine honored tribe-folk."
"Easy is the way for strangers:
Thou must journey through the forest,
Hasten to the river-border,
Travel one day, then a second,
And the third from morn till even,
To the north-west, thou must journey.
If a mountain comes to meet thee,
Go around the nearing mountain,
Westward bold thy weary journey,
Till thou comest to a river,
On thy right hand flowing eastward;
Travel to the river border,
Where three water-falls will greet</pre></div> </div>
