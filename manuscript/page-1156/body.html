Well the heavy sword be tempers,
Ornaments the hero-weapon
With the finest gold and silver.

Does the handle suit the bearer?
Yea, the blade and hilt are molded
To the wishes of the minstrel."

On the blade the sun is shining,
On the hilt the bright stars twinkle,
On the edge a horse is neighing,
On the handle plays a kitten,
On the sheath a dog is</pre></div> </div>
