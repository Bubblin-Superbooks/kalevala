Sang he youth with golden virtues,
Bearded youth with strength of heroes,
Sang them into mail of copper.
On the other side the vessel,
Sang he silver-tinselled maidens,
Girded them with belts of copper,
Golden rings upon their fingers.

Near the last beam of the vessel,
Steered his goodly boat in joyance,
Thus addressed the willing war-ship:
"Glide upon the trackless</pre></div> </div>
