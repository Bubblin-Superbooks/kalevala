Pebbles swim upon the Big-Sea,
Pines and lindens laugh with pleasure,
Alders skip about the heather,
And the aspen sways in concord.

Hasten forward like the current,
Speed along like rapid rivers,

Hear the harp of Wainamoinen.

Gray-haired mothers with their daughters
Stop in wonderment and</pre></div> </div>
