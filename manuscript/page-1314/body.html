<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">court-yard,
Cut the members into fragments,
Laid them in the heating caldrons,
In the copper-bottomed vesselsâ€”
O'er the fire the crane was hanging,
On the crane were hooks of copper,
On the hooks the broiling-vessels
Filled with bear-steak for the feasting,
Seasoned with the salt of Dwina,
From the Saxon-land imported,
From the distant Dwina-waters,
From the salt-sea brought in shallops.
Ready is the feast of Otso;
From the fire are swung the kettles
On the crane of polished iron;
In the centers of the tables
Is the bear displayed in dishes,
Golden dishes,</pre></div> </div>
