<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Moon-land,
On the shoulders of Otava,
With the daughters of creation.
"Through the ether walked a maiden,
On the red rims of the cloudlets,
On the border of the heavens,
In her stockings purple-tinted,
In her golden-colored sandals.
In her hand she held a wool-box,
With a hair-box on her shoulder;
Threw the wool upon the ocean,
And the hair upon the rivers;
These are rocked by winds and waters,
Water-currents bear them onward,
Bear them to the sandy sea-shore,
Land them near the Woods of honey,
On an island forest-covered.
"Fair Mielikki, woodland</pre></div> </div>
