To the forge of Ilmarinen.
This the question of the blacksmith
"Wherefore comest, dove of good-luck,
What the tidings that thou bringest?"
Thus the magic bird made answer:
"Wherefore come I to thy smithy?
Come to bring the joyful tidings
That the Sun has left his cavern,
Left the rock of many colors,
Left the stone-berg of Pohyola;
That the Moon no more is hidden
In the copper-bearing mountains,
In the caverns iron-banded."

To the threshold of his smithy,
Quickly scanned the far horizon,
Saw again the silver</pre></div> </div>
