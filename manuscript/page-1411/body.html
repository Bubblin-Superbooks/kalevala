<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">pity,
Source of both my good and evil,
Build for me a place befitting,
Where my troubles may be lessened,
And my heavy burdens lightened."
This the answer of the father,
Of the father unforgiving:
"Go, thou evil child of Hisi,
Go, thou child of sin and sorrow,
Wedded only to dishonor,
To the Great Bear's rocky chamber,
To the stone-cave of the growler,
There to lessen all thy troubles,
There to cast thy heavy burdens!"
Mariatta, child of beauty,
Thus made answer to her father:
"I am not a child of Hisi,
I am not a bride</pre></div> </div>
