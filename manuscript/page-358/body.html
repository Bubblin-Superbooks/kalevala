Swear thou also on thine honor,
Thou wilt go not to the village,
When desire for dance impels thee,
Wilt not visit village-dances."

Registered their vows in heaven,
Vowed before omniscient Ukko,

Whipped his racer to a gallop,

Roots of firs, and stumps of birch-trees.
That I wandered through in summer,
That I travelled o'er in</pre></div> </div>
