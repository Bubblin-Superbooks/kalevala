<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Rune Xiv.</h4><h3>Death Of Lemminkainen.</h3><pre class="  "><code>Lemminkainen, much disheartened,
Deeply thought and long considered,
What to do, what course to follow,
Whether best to leave the wild-moose
In the fastnesses of Hisi,
And return to Kalevala,
Or a third time hunt the ranger,
Hoping thus to bring him captive,
Thus return at last a victor
To the forest home of Louhi,
To the joy of all her daughters,
To the wood-nymph's happy fireside.
Taking courage</pre></div> </div>
