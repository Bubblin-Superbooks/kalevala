<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Manala:
Came to learn these magic sayings,
Learn the lost-words of the Master."
Spake the hostess, Tuonetar:
"Mana never gives these sayings,
Canst not learn them from Tuoni,
Not the lost-words of the Master;
Thou shalt never leave this kingdom,
Never in thy magic life-time,
Never go to Kalevala,
To Wainola's peaceful meadows.
To thy distant home and country."
Quick the hostess, Tuonetar,
Waves her magic wand of slumber
O'er the head of Wainamoinen,
Puts to rest the wisdom-hero,
Lays him on the couch of Mana,
In the robes of living</pre></div> </div>
