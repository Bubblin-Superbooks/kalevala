<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">serpents,
Vipers green their writhing covers,
For their drink the blood of adders,
For their food the pangs of hunger,
Pain and agony their solace;
If thou wishest joy eternal,
Shun the kingdom of Tuoui!"</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
