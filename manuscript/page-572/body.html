"Thou hast seven fleet-foot racers,
Munching grain within their mangers,
Which of these shall I make ready?"
Spake the blacksmith, Ilmarinen:
"Take the fleetest of my coursers,
Put the gray steed in the harness,
Hitch him to my sledge of magic;
Place six cuckoos on the break-board,
Seven bluebirds on the cross-bars,
Thus to charm the Northland maidens,
Thus to make them look and listen,
As the cuckoos call and echo.
Bring me too my largest bear-skin,
Fold it warm about the cross-bench;
Bring me then my marten fur-robes,
As a cover and protection."
Straightway then the trusty</pre></div> </div>
