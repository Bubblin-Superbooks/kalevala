<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">hero,
Do not care to rock the billows,
Cannot live with such a husband
Storms would bring us pain and trouble,
Winds would rack our hearts and temples;
Therefore thee I cannot follow,
Cannot keep thy home in order,
Cannot be thy life-companion,
Cannot wed old Wainamoinen."</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
