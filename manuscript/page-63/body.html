<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">the coincidence of the Magyar Ukkon and the Finnish Ukko was
placed beyond doubt.</p><p>The Kalevala (the Land of Heroes relates the ever-varying contests  )</p><p>between the Finns and the "darksome Laplanders", just as the Iliad
relates the contests between the Greeks and the Trojans.  Castren is of
the opinion that the enmity between the Finns and the Lapps was sung
long before the Finns had left their Asiatic birth-place.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">A deeper and more esoteric meaning of the Kalevala, however, points to
a contest between Light and Darkness, Good and Evil; the Finns
representing the Light and the Good, and the Lapps, the Darkness and
the Evil.  Like the Niebelungs, the heroes of the Finns woo for brides
the beauteous maidens of the North; and the similarity is rendered
still more striking by their frequent inroads into the country of the
Lapps, in order to possess themselves of the envied treasure of
Lapland,</p></div> </div>
