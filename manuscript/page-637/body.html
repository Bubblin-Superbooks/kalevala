Finds within a splinter lying
From the bottom lifts the fragment,
Turns it in her fingers, musing:
'What may come of this I know not,
In the hands of magic maidens,
In the virgin hands of Kapo,
Snowy virgin of the Northland!'

And produced a snow-white squirrel;

Flower of the field and forest,
Haste thee whither I would send</pre></div> </div>
