Must forget thy former customs,

Thou must love thy husband's brother,
Lower must thy head be bended,
Kind words only must thou utter.

Must forget thy former customs,
Sister-love must be forsaken,
Thou must love thy husband's sister,
Lower must thy head be bended,
Kind words only must thou utter.
"Never in the course of ages,
Never while the moonlight glimmers,
Wickedly approach thy household,
Nor unworthily, thy servants,
Nor thy courts with indiscretion;
Let thy dwellings sing good</pre></div> </div>
