Long he gazed on Lemminkainen,
Then the eagle thus addressed him:
"Whither art thou driving, Ahti,
Whither going, Lemminkainen?"

To the drinking-halls of Louhi,
To the banquet of her people;
Move aside and let me journey,
Move a little from my pathway,
Let this wanderer pass by thee,
I am warlike Lemminkainen."
This the answer of the eagle,
Screaming from his throat of splendor:
"Though thou art wild Lemminkainen,
I shall let thee wander</pre></div> </div>
