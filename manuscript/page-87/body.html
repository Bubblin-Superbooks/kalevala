As I wander through the ocean.
Ukko, thou O God, up yonder,
Thou the ruler of the heavens,

Come I pray thee, hither hasten,
Hasten more that thou art needed,
Haste and help this helpless maiden!"

Hastens toward the water-mother,
Comes a-flying hither, thither,
Seeks herself a place for nesting.
Flies she eastward, flies she</pre></div> </div>
