<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">unwelcome,
Since the waiters bring no viands,
Bring no dishes to the stranger?"
Ilpotar, the Northland hostess,
Then addressed the words that follow:
"Lemminkainen, thou art evil,
Thou art here, but not invited,
Thou hast not the look of kindness,
Thou wilt give me throbbing temples,
Thou art bringing pain and sorrow.
All our beer is in the barley,
All the malt is in the kernel,
All our grain is still ungarnered,
And our dinner has been eaten;
Yesterday thou shouldst have been here,
Come again some future season."
Whereupon wild Lemminkainen
Pulled his mouth awry in</pre></div> </div>
