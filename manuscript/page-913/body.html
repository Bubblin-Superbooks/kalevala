That I may in its protection
Hasten to my native country,
To my mother's Island-dwelling,
Fly to her that waits my coming,

Flew and soared on eagle-pinions,

Spied a gray-hawk soaring near him,
In his eyes the fire of splendor,

Like the eyes of Pohya's spearmen,
And the gray-hawk thus addressed him:
"Ho! There! hero, Lemminkainen,
Art thou thinking of our combat
With the hero-heads of Northland?"
Thus the Islander made</pre></div> </div>
