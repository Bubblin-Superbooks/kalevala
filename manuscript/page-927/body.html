<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">pursuers,
In the times of summer conquests,
In the darksome days of battle;
Good the isle for thee to dwell in,
Goodly place to live and linger;
Hide one year, and then a second,
In the third return in safety
To thy mother's island dwelling,
To thy father's ancient mansion,
To my hero's place of resting."</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
