Where he had not seen the moonlight,
Had not seen the silver sunshine.
Thereupon these words be uttered,
Let himself be heard in this wise:

Take me, thou, O Sun above me,

From these unbefitting portals,
From this narrow place of resting,
From this dark and gloomy dwelling,

Hence to walk upon the islands,
On the dry land walk and wander,
Like an ancient hero wander,
Walk in open air and breathe it,
Thus to see the moon at</pre></div> </div>
